# NSP - Summary of Hw 3
A probabilistic generative model for classification comprises class-conditional densities and class priors. Three generative models are considered:    
        Gaussian, shared covariance  
        Gaussian, class-specific covariance  
        Poisson  
1. For each maximum likelihood model (ML), the mean, covariance (ellipse), and derived multi-class decision boundaries, corresponding to the decision rule, are plotted.   
2.  ML model parameters are fitted to the training data and then tested on test data according to the decision rule.
